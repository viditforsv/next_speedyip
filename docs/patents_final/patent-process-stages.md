# Patent Process Stages

## Six-Stage Patent Journey

### 1. Novelty Search

**Description**: Comprehensive prior art search to ensure your invention is novel and non-obvious.

**Marketing Model**: Focused structural check to validate newness for filing.
**Enforcement Model**: Functional + structural sweep to support broader protection.
**Strategic Model**: Multi-variant mapping to plan filings around product/technology/solution.

**Effort Level**: Marketing (1/4), Enforcement (2/4), Strategic (3/4)

### 2. Provisional Specification Preparation and Filing

**Description**: Initial patent application filing with provisional protection.

**Marketing Model**: Quick, compliant PS to secure an early date.
**Enforcement Model**: PS with multiple embodiments/use-cases to prepare for breadth.
**Strategic Model**: PS planning for multiple specs/splits aligned to roadmap.

**Effort Level**: Marketing (1/4), Enforcement (2/4), Strategic (3/4)

### 3. Complete Specification Drafting and Filing (with Pre-exam formalities)

**Description**: Full patent application with complete technical specification.

**Marketing Model**: Lean claims and clear drafting aimed at faster grant; all pre-exam formalities handled.
**Enforcement Model**: Broadest defensible claims, multiple embodiments, enablement validated; all pre-exam formalities handled.
**Strategic Model**: Layered specs, splits, and PCT-ready drafting; all pre-exam formalities handled.

**Effort Level**: Marketing (2/4), Enforcement (4/4), Strategic (4/4)

### 4. FER Response

**Description**: Handle First Examination Report from patent office.

**Marketing Model**: Grant-first amendments and arguments.
**Enforcement Model**: Breadth-protecting arguments; alternative claim sets; divisionals if needed.
**Strategic Model**: Portfolio choreography: breadth defense + gap-filling filings (divisionals/fresh).

**Effort Level**: Marketing (2/4), Enforcement (3/4), Strategic (4/4)

### 5. Hearing & Written Submissions

**Description**: Oral hearings and written submissions to patent office.

**Marketing Model**: Acceptance-oriented representation with concise submissions.
**Enforcement Model**: Weigh breadth vs allowability; argue to minimize workarounds.
**Strategic Model**: Keep ring-fence offensive across jurisdictions; coordinate family timelines.

**Effort Level**: Marketing (2/4), Enforcement (3/4), Strategic (4/4)

### 6. Final Application Disposal (Grant/Refusal)

**Description**: Final decision on patent application.

**Marketing Model**: Path to grant finalized; post-grant guidance provided.
**Enforcement Model**: Grant with stronger scope for enforcement/licensing.
**Strategic Model**: Grant plus portfolio completeness and risk mitigation.

**Effort Level**: Marketing (1/4), Enforcement (1/4), Strategic (1/4)

## Post-Grant Requirements

After grant, the following are mandatory under Indian Patent Law:

- **Annual Maintenance Fees** (renewal fees)
- **Form 27** submissions

Applicable costs for these stages will be shared when such requirements arise.
